# re_dev

The reason I set this repo is just to let you know that I am here to talk if you want. The last thing I want to see is you exhausting yourself even a bit, which should be a restful and peaceful vacation that we rarely get. I also dropped you a Teams message wishing you to have a restful vacation for the same purpose. I don't want to push anything; that's not my plan. I just wish you are good.

I am going to FL today, hope you enjoy your rest of vacation, I will talk with you in office.

By the way, my dogs name is Valley, hope you love him! he is so intelligent and being a good friend of mine.

Hope 2026 is packed with sufferings and memories.
